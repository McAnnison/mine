Group 18: Microkernel Operating System Design

Project Description

Design and implement a microkernel-based operating system with minimal kernel functionality and user-space services.

Specific Requirements

In addition to the common requirements, this group must:

- Implement minimal kernel with basic IPC mechanisms
- Move traditional kernel services to user space
- Implement message passing between components
- Create at least 3 user-space services
- Demonstrate fault isolation benefits
- Compare performance with monolithic design
